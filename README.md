# web-scraping

Web scraping + EDA: Using tables from the Basketball reference league tables data, I scraped the latest 2022 athletes' data, cleaned it and did some elementart exploration. I used Pandas for the majority of my analysis and chose to switch to Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualisation. Further visualisation can be found on my Tableau public profile
